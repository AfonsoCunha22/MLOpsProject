<p>Sentiment Analysis  </p>
<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to perform <strong>sentiment analysis</strong> on <strong>English song lyrics</strong>, filtering out non-English lyrics from the dataset. Sentiment analysis provides insights into the emotional tone of song lyrics, classifying sentiments into five categories: Very Negative, Negative, Neutral, Positive, and Very Positive.  </p>
<p>We leverage <strong>Hugging Face</strong> and pre-trained language models for sentiment classification. By employing state-of-the-art tools and best practices in MLOps, we aim to create a scalable and reproducible pipeline for analyzing large datasets of song lyrics.  </p>
<p>This project incorporates multiple components of MLOps, including <strong>data versioning</strong>, <strong>experiment tracking</strong>, <strong>pipeline reproducibility</strong>, and <strong>containerization</strong>, ensuring a streamlined and efficient workflow.</p>
<h2><strong>Frameworks and Tools</strong></h2>
<p>To achieve the project's objectives, we use the following tools and frameworks:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hugging Face</strong>: For building the baseline and utilizing pre-trained sentiment analysis models.  </li>
<li><strong>DVC (Data Version Control)</strong>: For managing dataset versioning and ensuring data consistency across team members.  </li>
<li><strong>Weights &amp; Biases (W&amp;B)</strong>: To track experiments, monitor performance metrics, and visualize model training.  </li>
<li><strong>Hydra</strong>: For configuration management to ensure reproducibility of experiments.  </li>
<li><strong>Docker</strong>: To containerize the entire pipeline, facilitating portability and deployment across different environments.  </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Dataset</strong></h2>
<p>The dataset used for this project includes song lyrics scraped from <strong>Genius</strong>, a platform where users can upload and annotate lyrics. The dataset, which includes songs as recent as 2022, is based on the <strong>5 Million Song Lyrics Dataset</strong> and has been augmented with language identification information using pre-trained models.  </p>
<p>For this project, we filter the dataset to include <strong>only English song lyrics</strong>, as they form the focus of our sentiment analysis. The processed dataset can be found on Kaggle: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlosgdcj/genius-song-lyrics-with-language-information">Genius Song Lyrics with Language Information</a>.  </p>
<h2><strong>Model</strong></h2>
<p>The sentiment analysis is conducted using the <strong>tabularisai/multilingual-sentiment-analysis</strong> model, a fine-tuned version of <strong>distilbert-base-multilingual-cased</strong>. Key features of the model:  </p>
<ul>
<li>It is fine-tuned for <strong>multilingual sentiment analysis</strong>.  </li>
<li>Trained exclusively on <strong>synthetic multilingual data</strong> generated by advanced large language models (LLMs).  </li>
<li>The model achieves robust performance across various languages and cultural contexts.  </li>
<li>It classifies sentiment into five categories: <strong>Very Negative</strong>, <strong>Negative</strong>, <strong>Neutral</strong>, <strong>Positive</strong>, and <strong>Very Positive</strong>.  </li>
</ul>
<p>By using synthetic data, the model ensures a broad coverage of sentiment expressions while reducing bias, making it suitable for tasks involving diverse datasets. The reference model can be found on Hugging Face: <a href="https://huggingface.co/tabularisai/multilingual-sentiment-analysis">Multilingual Sentiment Analysis</a></p>
